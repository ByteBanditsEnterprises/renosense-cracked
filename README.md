# [ I'm fucked, what should I do? ] 

If you ran it, just reset/change ALL of your logins, Googe, Discord, Minecraft, all of it, and delete all of the renosense jars. Check %temp%/CortanaAssistant.jar (AppData\Local\Temp\CortanaAssistant.jar) and if it is there, delete it. Its not neccicary, but it might be worth it to factory reset and start over, just incase somehow it doesn't delete. Which it probably will, but still take it into consideration.
