security sucks ass, get a bigger brain

shit pasted rat with BTC miner in it

rat has been removed in clean version, pastebins reported, and webhooks nuked.
  
+ Not 100% sure if this is the real one, its the one thats been being passed around by the users. They claim it is from the server and is the original though.

# [ I'm fucked, what should I do? ] 

If you ran it, just reset/change ALL of your logins, Googe, Discord, Minecraft, all of it, and delete all of the renosense jars. Check %temp%/CortanaAssistant.jar (AppData\Local\Temp\CortanaAssistant.jar) and if it is there, delete it. Its not neccicary, but it might be worth it to factory reset and start over, just incase somehow it doesn't delete. Which it probably will, but still take it into consideration.
